# Small-Scale Crop Mapping Application
- Farming is the main source of livelihood for smallscale farmers and they account for 30% of the total food produced to the economy therefore there is a need to analyse and predict the amount of food small scale farmers can produce at a certain season and get to predict the deficit to the economy.
- This was built to help the government make data driven decisions on the state of food scarcity 
- This is a GUI application https://2a81-41-89-227-65.ngrok.io/voila/render/notebook/cropmapping.ipynb built with python and google earth engine that  uses AI/ML to classify crops in different areas across the country,calculate the area of the farms and  predict the  yield for these crops.
